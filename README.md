# newwebsite
<h1>This is my new website I'm making over quarantine.</h1>
 <body> I'm using a website called coding academy to make this and as I advance I will add to this website</body>
  <p> So far what I've learned is to use things like h(header) and a number, body and a number, p(paragraph) and a number, and div(division) although I don't yet know when to use it.
